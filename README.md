# [My Task Board](https://hamutalg.github.io/MyTaskBoard/)
#### JavaScript - HTML - CSS3

A one-page webpage to organize "to-do" tasks.  
The user is able to add a variety of different tasks to the main board, while each task includes a due-time and due-date (using RegExp, time is not required).  
Each task is written in the main form and when finished is shown on a "sticky-note". The sticky notes are added to the board by the order that they are created.  
The user is able to edit, as well as delete, each task.   
The tasks on the board are saved in the browser's "local storage" (through JSON format).  

The project is written using:

  - HTML5, with the use of Bootstrap
  - Box-Model - CSS3 and Transitions
  - JavaScript
        - LocalStorage    
        - DOM Manipulation
        - Events
        - Arrays, Objects
        - JSON
  

##### Installation:

This project requires a source code editor.  
I used [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
